## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a Threat Hunt

```typescript
import { threatHuntingService } from './features/threat-hunting/services/ThreatHuntingService';

// Create hunt
const hunt = await threatHuntingService.createHunt({
  name: 'APT Detection Campaign',
  description: 'Hunt for APT indicators',
  hypothesis: 'APT29 activity in network',
  category: 'apt_detection',
  techniques: ['T1566.001', 'T1059.001'],
  platforms: ['Windows'],
  dataSources: ['Process Monitoring'],
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  createdBy: 'analyst@company.com',
});

// Add query
await threatHuntingService.addQueryToHunt(hunt.id, {
  name: 'Suspicious PowerShell',
  queryLanguage: 'splunk_spl',
  query: 'search index=windows EventCode=4688 | where CommandLine LIKE "%encoded%"',
  dataSource: 'splunk_prod',
  timeRange: {
    start: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    end: new Date(),
    timezone: 'UTC',
  },
});

// Execute hunt
await threatHuntingService.startHunt(hunt.id);
```

### 2. Monitor Progress

```typescript
threatHuntingService.on('hunt_completed', (completedHunt) => {
  console.log(`Hunt complete!`);
  console.log(`Findings: ${completedHunt.findings.length}`);
  console.log(`Confidence: ${completedHunt.confidence}`);
});

threatHuntingService.on('hunt_failed', ({ hunt, error }) => {
  console.error(`Hunt failed: ${error}`);
});
```

### 3. Analyze Findings

```typescript
const hunt = await threatHuntingService.getHunt(huntId);

// Filter high-confidence findings
const highConfidence = hunt.findings.filter(f => f.confidence > 0.7);

for (const finding of highConfidence) {
  console.log(`${finding.severity}: ${finding.title}`);
  console.log(`MITRE Techniques: ${finding.techniques.join(', ')}`);
  console.log(`Evidence: ${finding.evidence.length} items`);
  console.log(`Affected Assets: ${finding.affectedAssets.join(', ')}`);
}
```
