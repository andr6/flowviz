echo "3. WHAT WAS FIXED:"

echo "AFTER (Fixed):"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ body { margin: 0; min-width: 320px; min-height: 100vh; } - clean base"

echo "EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo ""
echo "1. LOGIN FORM (if not authenticated):"
echo "   - Should be perfectly centered on the page"
echo "   - Responsive design works on all screen sizes"
echo "   - Beautiful gradient background with centered form"
echo ""
echo "2. MAIN APP (if authenticated):"
echo "   - App should fill the entire viewport properly"
echo "   - Content should not be improperly centered"
echo "   - Normal app layout behavior restored"
echo ""
echo "3. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:"
echo "   - Both login and app layouts work on mobile/tablet/desktop"
echo "   - No layout conflicts between components"

echo ""
echo "If layout still looks wrong:"
echo "  1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R"
echo "  2. Clear browser cache"
echo "  3. Check browser console for any CSS errors"

echo "‚úÖ LOGIN FORM AND APP LAYOUT CENTERING FIXED!"
echo "   Removed conflicting body flex styles that interfered with React layout."
