## 🛠️ Testing Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
# Opens at http://localhost:4173/
```

### Check Bundle Sizes
```bash
npm run build
# View output in terminal
```

### Analyze Bundle
```bash
# Install analyzer
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer

# Add to vite.config.ts plugins array:
# visualizer({ open: true })

# Then build
npm run build
```

---

## 🔍 How to Validate

### 1. Build Success ✅
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete in ~1m 20s
# Should show 24 chunks
# Main entry should be ~8.56 kB gzipped
```

### 2. Service Worker ✅
```bash
npm run preview
# Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
# Should show registered worker
```

### 3. Caching ✅
```bash
# 1. Load app in preview mode
# 2. DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
# 3. Should see:
#    - threatflow-cache-v1
#    - threatflow-runtime-v1
```

### 4. Offline Mode ✅
```bash
# 1. Load app in preview mode
# 2. DevTools → Network → Offline
# 3. Refresh page
# 4. App should load from cache ✅
```

### 5. Performance Profiling
```bash
# 1. Install React DevTools browser extension
# 2. Open DevTools → Profiler
# 3. Record interaction
# 4. Check for reduced re-renders
```

## 🎨 Code Splitting Strategy

### Vendors (Load Once)
```
react-vendor.js     - React + React DOM
mui-material.js     - Material-UI components
mui-icons.js        - Material-UI icons
d3-vendor.js        - D3.js visualization
vendor.js           - Other dependencies
```

### Features (Load on Demand)
```
feature-app.js                  - Core UI (eager)
feature-flow-analysis.js        - Attack flow viz (lazy)
feature-ioc-analysis.js         - IOC extraction (lazy)
feature-flow-storage.js         - Save/load (lazy)
feature-auth.js                 - Authentication (lazy)
feature-flow-export.js          - Export (lazy)
feature-*-mapping.js            - Feature pages (lazy)
```

### Shared (Load as Needed)
```
shared-components.js  - Reusable UI
shared-theme.js       - Theme system
shared-services.js    - Shared services
```

## ⚡ Performance Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Wrap callbacks with `useCallback` for child components
- Use React.memo for components that render often
- Lazy load heavy components and routes
- Split vendors and features into separate chunks
- Cache vendor bundles aggressively
- Use service worker for offline support
- Persist query cache for faster repeat visits

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't use `any` type in TypeScript
- Don't leave console.log in production code
- Don't load all features upfront
- Don't skip memoization for expensive operations
- Don't forget useEffect dependencies
- Don't over-optimize (measure first)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
npm install
npm run build
```

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure using HTTPS or localhost
- Verify service-worker.js exists in dist/
- Check `import.meta.env.PROD` is true

### Large Bundle Warning
```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB
```
- This is expected for vendor.js (669 kB)
- Vendors are cached separately
- Not a concern after first load

### Preview Server Won't Start
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "vite preview"

# Restart preview
npm run preview
```

## 📊 Monitoring in Production

### Key Metrics to Track
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte): < 200ms
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): < 1.5s
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **TTI** (Time to Interactive): < 3.5s
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

### Tools
- Google Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools)
- WebPageTest (https://www.webpagetest.org/)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools
- Bundle analyzer (webpack-bundle-analyzer)

### CI/CD Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- Bundle size increases > 10%
- Lighthouse score drops < 90
- Build time increases > 20%

## 🔄 Future Optimizations

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Add responsive images
   - Lazy load images below fold

2. **Font Optimization**
   - Subset fonts to used glyphs
   - Use font-display: swap
   - Preload critical fonts

3. **Further Splitting**
   - Split vendor.js further if needed
   - Consider micro-frontends for very large apps

4. **CDN**
   - Serve static assets from CDN
   - Use edge caching for global users

5. **HTTP/2 Server Push**
   - Push critical resources
   - Consider HTTP/3 for better performance
