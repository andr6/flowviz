- Fuzzy matching for similar indicators
- Infrastructure overlap detection (domain families, IP subnets)
- Confidence scoring based on enrichment data

### 2. TTP Pattern Recognition
- MITRE ATT&CK technique similarity
- Tactic-level correlation
- Kill chain phase analysis
- Behavioral pattern matching

### 3. Infrastructure Overlap Detection
- Shared C2 infrastructure
- Domain family analysis
- IP subnet correlation
- Certificate fingerprint matching

### 4. Temporal Correlation
- Attack timing pattern analysis
- Configurable time windows
- Proximity scoring with decay
- Campaign lifecycle tracking

### 5. Campaign Management
- Automatic campaign creation
- Campaign merging for similar patterns
- Severity and confidence scoring
- Actor attribution suggestions
- Affected asset tracking

   - Trigger correlation analysis on new flows
   - Auto-assign flows to campaigns

2. **IOC Extraction**
   - Use extracted IOCs for correlation
   - Enrich IOCs with threat intel
   - Track IOC evolution

3. **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**
   - Use technique IDs for TTP correlation
   - Map to defensive countermeasures
   - Generate coverage reports

4. **Threat Intelligence Feeds**
   - Enrich campaigns with external data
   - Actor attribution from TI feeds
   - Indicator reputation scoring

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { ThreatCorrelationEngine } from '@/features/threat-correlation';
import { pool } from '@/shared/services/database';

// Initialize engine
const engine = new ThreatCorrelationEngine(pool, {
  minCorrelationScore: 0.4,
  campaignDetectionThreshold: 0.7
});

// Analyze correlations
const result = await engine.analyzeFlowRelationships();
console.log(`Found ${result.correlationsFound} correlations`);

// Detect campaigns
const campaigns = await engine.detectCampaigns();
console.log(`Detected ${campaigns.newCampaigns.length} new campaigns`);

// Build threat graph
const graph = await engine.buildThreatGraph(campaignId);

// Generate report
const report = await engine.exportCampaignReport(campaignId);
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Database schema created
2. ‚úÖ TypeScript types defined
3. ‚úÖ Core service implemented
4. üîÑ Complete IOC matching algorithms
5. üîÑ Implement TTP pattern recognition
6. ‚è≥ Create React UI components
7. ‚è≥ Add API endpoints to server.ts
8. ‚è≥ Integrate with flow storage
9. ‚è≥ Add scheduled correlation jobs
10. ‚è≥ Implement real-time notifications

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes on all foreign keys and query columns
- JSONB indexes for metadata fields
- Materialized views for analytics
- Batch processing for large correlation jobs
- Caching for frequently accessed campaigns
- Pagination for large result sets

## Security Considerations

- RBAC for campaign access
- Audit logging for all operations
- Data retention policies
- Sensitive IOC handling
- Export restrictions for classified data

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for matching algorithms
2. Integration tests for database operations
3. E2E tests for campaign detection
4. Performance tests with large datasets
5. UI component tests with React Testing Library

## Documentation

- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- User guide for SOC analysts
- Admin guide for configuration
- Developer guide for extensions
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
