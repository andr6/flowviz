# Code Review Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures consistent, high-quality code reviews across all pull requests. Use this as a guide to maintain code quality, security, and maintainability standards.

---

## üìã General Guidelines

- [ ] **Review Scope**: Changes are focused and address a single concern
- [ ] **PR Description**: Clear description of what changed and why
- [ ] **Size**: PR is reasonably sized (< 400 lines changed ideally)
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Breaking changes are clearly documented
- [ ] **Related Issues**: PR is linked to relevant issues/tickets

---

## üèóÔ∏è Code Structure

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] Changes follow established architectural patterns (feature-based structure)
- [ ] New features are placed in appropriate directories (`src/features/` or `src/shared/`)
- [ ] Components follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data access)
- [ ] Avoid circular dependencies
- [ ] Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - no unnecessary duplication

### File Organization
- [ ] File and folder naming follows conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- [ ] Imports are organized logically (external ‚Üí internal ‚Üí relative)
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] File size is reasonable (< 400 lines; consider splitting larger files)

### Component Structure
- [ ] Components have clear, single purpose
- [ ] Proper component composition (avoid God components)
- [ ] Custom hooks are used for reusable logic
- [ ] Context providers are not over-nested
- [ ] Higher-order components (HOCs) are used appropriately

---

## üìñ Readability

### Naming Conventions
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive and meaningful
- [ ] Function names clearly describe their purpose (use verbs: `handleClick`, `fetchData`)
- [ ] Boolean variables/functions use `is`, `has`, `should` prefixes
- [ ] Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- [ ] Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- [ ] Type/interface names are descriptive and use PascalCase

### Code Clarity
- [ ] Code is self-documenting (clear variable/function names)
- [ ] Complex logic is broken down into smaller, named functions
- [ ] Magic numbers are replaced with named constants
- [ ] Ternary operators are not nested (max 1 level)
- [ ] No commented-out code (use version control instead)
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code (use logger utility)

### Formatting
- [ ] Code follows project's ESLint rules
- [ ] Consistent indentation (2 spaces for JS/TS/TSX)
- [ ] Proper spacing around operators and after commas
- [ ] Max line length respected (100-120 characters)
- [ ] Logical grouping with blank lines between sections

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Error Management
- [ ] All async operations have proper error handling (try-catch or .catch())
- [ ] Errors are caught at appropriate levels
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Errors are logged with sufficient context (use logger utility)
- [ ] No empty catch blocks (at minimum, log the error)
- [ ] Custom error classes are used where appropriate

### Validation
- [ ] Input validation is performed before processing
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (null, undefined, empty arrays/objects)
- [ ] Form validation provides clear feedback
- [ ] API responses are validated before use
- [ ] Type guards are used for runtime type checking

### Resilience
- [ ] Loading states are shown for async operations
- [ ] Error states provide recovery options (retry, fallback)
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Graceful degradation for missing features/data
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections

---

## üìö Documentation

### Code Comments
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] **Why** is documented (not **what** - code should show what)
- [ ] TODOs include owner and issue number (`// TODO(username): Fix X - Issue #123`)
- [ ] No misleading or outdated comments
- [ ] JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions

### Type Definitions
- [ ] All functions have proper TypeScript types (no `any` unless absolutely necessary)
- [ ] Interfaces/types are well-documented with comments
- [ ] Complex types are exported and reused
- [ ] Generic types are used appropriately
- [ ] Discriminated unions for complex state types

### Documentation Files
- [ ] README.md is updated if public API changes
- [ ] CLAUDE.md is updated if architecture/commands change
- [ ] New features have usage examples
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented in CHANGELOG (if applicable)
- [ ] Environment variables are documented in .env.example

---

## ‚ö° Performance

### React Performance
- [ ] Components are memoized where appropriate (React.memo)
- [ ] useMemo for expensive computations
- [ ] useCallback for functions passed to memoized child components
- [ ] Context values are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary re-renders (check with React DevTools Profiler)
- [ ] Large lists use virtualization (react-window) if > 100 items

### Code Efficiency
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary loops or nested loops
- [ ] Use efficient data structures (Map/Set vs Array for lookups)
- [ ] Debounce/throttle expensive operations (search, resize, scroll)
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components and routes
- [ ] Images are optimized and use appropriate formats
- [ ] Large dependencies are code-split

### Network Performance
- [ ] API calls are not made in loops
- [ ] Data is cached appropriately (React Query)
- [ ] Pagination/infinite scroll for large datasets
- [ ] GraphQL queries request only needed fields
- [ ] Proper use of HTTP caching headers

### Bundle Size
- [ ] No large dependencies added without justification
- [ ] Tree-shakeable imports (import specific exports, not entire libraries)
- [ ] Webpack bundle analyzer used for significant changes
- [ ] Dynamic imports for code splitting

- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries)
- [ ] No `eval()` or `Function()` constructor
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- [ ] File uploads have type/size validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Authentication checks are in place for protected routes

## üí° Best Practices

### Before Review
1. Self-review your code first
2. Run tests and linting locally
3. Check for console errors/warnings
4. Review the diff to ensure no unintended changes
5. Update documentation as needed

### During Review
1. Be constructive and specific in feedback
2. Distinguish between "must fix" and "nice to have"
3. Approve if changes meet standards, even if not perfect
4. Consider the bigger picture, not just code style
5. Ask questions if something is unclear

### After Review
1. Respond to all comments (resolve or discuss)
2. Re-request review after significant changes
3. Ensure CI/CD passes before merging
4. Verify deployment in staging environment
5. Monitor production for issues post-merge
