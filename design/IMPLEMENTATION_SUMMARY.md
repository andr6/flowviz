## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migration
psql -U postgres -d threatflow < scripts/migrations/create_threat_correlation_tables.sql
```

### 2. Initialize Engine
```typescript
import { ThreatCorrelationEngine } from '@/features/threat-correlation';
import { pool } from '@/shared/services/database';

const engine = new ThreatCorrelationEngine(pool);

// Analyze correlations
const result = await engine.analyzeFlowRelationships();

// Detect campaigns
const campaigns = await engine.detectCampaigns();
```

### 3. Use Dashboard Component
```typescript
import { CampaignDetectionDashboard } from '@/features/threat-correlation/components';

function CampaignsPage() {
  return (
    <CampaignDetectionDashboard
      onCampaignClick={(campaign) => console.log(campaign)}
      onAnalyzeClick={() => console.log('Analyzing...')}
    />
  );
}
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Analyze Specific Flows
```typescript
const result = await engine.analyzeFlowRelationships([
  'flow-id-1',
  'flow-id-2',
  'flow-id-3'
]);

console.log(`Found ${result.correlationsFound} correlations`);
console.log(`Average score: ${result.averageScore}`);
```

### Create Campaign Manually
```typescript
const campaign = await engine.createCampaign({
  name: 'APT29 Campaign',
  flowIds: ['flow-1', 'flow-2'],
  severity: 'high',
  suspectedActor: 'APT29',
  tags: ['espionage', 'government']
});
```

### Generate Report
```typescript
const report = await engine.exportCampaignReport(campaignId);
console.log(report.executiveSummary);
console.log(report.recommendations);
```
